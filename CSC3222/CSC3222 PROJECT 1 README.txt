The first submitted solution only contained work for Project 1.
This submitted solution includes work for both Project 1 and Project 2.

have comments at the top identifying them. These include:

New:
PhysicsResolver class (Frameworks folder)
Collision class (Frameworks folder)
Vec3 class (Game/CSC3222P1)

Significant changes:
